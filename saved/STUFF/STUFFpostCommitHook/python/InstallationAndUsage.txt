Installation:
  1. Copy the contents of the hooks directory into the hooks directory of the svn repository.
  2. Check if svnlook is in your PATH:
      $ which svnlook
     If it was not in your PATH you will need to add it to postCommitHook.properties PATH variable after the next step.
  3. Run the configure.py script:  $ python configure.py
    - prompts user for default delay value
    - generates the post-commit file, tools/post-commit/lib/postCommitHook.properties file, and the logs directory (all relative to the hooks folder).
    - should configure the permissions on logs directory, but doesn't always work right so you may need to run:
      $ chmod -R 755 logs post-commit
      $ chmod 755 post-commit
      $ chmod 755 post-commit.py
  4. Test.
